# The input file is a csv containing the GPS data and ground truth. The file name should follow the generic
# format: '<test phone number>_<tester alias>_<date data recorded>.csv', where test phone number is a 
# 9-digit number with no brackets and hyphens, and date data recorded is in MMDDYY format.
# 
# The file should contain fourteen columns. The first nine columns denote the tester ID, timestamp (in epoch time, 
# recorded in milliseconds), latitude, longitude, GPS accuracy (in feet), battery status (in percentage), 
# sampling rate (in seconds), accelermoeter reading, activity as inferred by the Google API, and PST time, respectively. 
# The values for each of these fields will be generated by the tracking app installed on the test phone in 
# the appropriate units, and you shouldn't have to change anything.
#
# The next four columns reflect the ground truth that will be used to train our inference algorithms.
# The eleventh column can take on two string values: (1) Trip, if the individual at the time was making a trip; 
# or (2) Activity, if the individual at the time was engaging in an activity. Columns twelve to fourteen 
# are strings containing information regarding the trip or activity.
#
# Finally, the rows in the file should be ordered in terms of increasing time.
